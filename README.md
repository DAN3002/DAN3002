- I had the opportunity to start college at the age of 16, and started working a year later (17 years old). My interests are in cloud computing as well as software development.
- Along with that, I also have experience in teaching, I was recognized as an **AWS Authorized Instructor** and was the main instructor in 2 Bootcamps in Vietnam.

I am always open to new opportunities and challenges. If you would like to reach me, feel free to drop me a message. You can visit my pinned repo to see some of my pet projects or learning projects. Or go to [my online website.](https://dan3002.tech/)
